# Sensorized-Objects CAD Files
In this folder you can find the CAD files and needed to manufacture the components in the object set. 

## Folder Contents
The objects have been organised into there relative sizes and the rigid and soft surface components are present in all sizes. 
**Large size -** Contains the lagest sized object set CAD files <br/>
**Medium size -** Contains the medium sized object set CAD files <br/>
**Small size -** Contains the smallest sized object set CAD files <br/>
**Common parts -** Contains  CAD files common components across the 3 sizes (e.g. markers) <br/>

## Object Assembly
![explodedView3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54158341/73730014-f4740000-479a-11ea-8336-e72841e834bf.jpg)
Each object of the sensorized object set consists of 5 to 13 parts:
* a plastic screw (which holds the object together)
* two object halves (these halves can be objects of any size and surface stiffness)
* two removable urethane marker mounts
* eight removable object weights (optional components)

# Fabrication 

## 3D printing
STL files have been included in each folder type.
### Platic Threads
If the plastic screw does not screw into the object a **M8 tap and die** can be used to fix any tolerancing errors introdruced by the 3D printing proccess.

**NOTE:** The plastic screws should not be overtightened or they will break (using SLA or SLS printing proccesses can increase the strength of the screw).

## Moulding
### Urethane/ Silicone Mixing
**Note:** Before moulding the mould should be sprayed with mould release and **ensure not to spray objects** as this may prevent the objects soft skin from sticking correctly to the soft object halves. 
1. Read the unrethane/ silicone instructions to determine **mix ratio** and **work time**
    - Work time will determine how quickly you will need to degas and inject the material into the mould.
2. Pour appropriate resin and hardener portions instructed by the suppliers mix ratio.
3. Mix togeather thoroughly.
5. Place mixture into vacuum chamber to degas. 
6. Pour or inject urethane/ silicone mixture into mould. 
### Markers
#### AR Markers
#### Polhemus Markers
#### Optical Markers

### Soft Objects 
Before moulding the objects a narrow nozzle syringe needs to be prepared in order for the chosen urethane or silicone to reach the small narrow gaps without air bubbles.
