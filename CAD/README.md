# Sensorized-Objects CAD Files
In this folder you can find the CAD files and needed to manufacture the components in the object set. 

## Folder Contents
The objects have been organised into there relative sizes and the rigid and soft surface components are present in all sizes. 
**Large size -** Contains the lagest sized object set CAD files <br/>
**Medium size -** Contains the medium sized object set CAD files <br/>
**Small size -** Contains the smallest sized object set CAD files <br/>
**Common parts -** Contains  CAD files common components across the 3 sizes (e.g. markers) <br/>

Each object of the sensorized object set consists of 5 to 13 parts:
* a plastic screw (which holds the object together)
* two object halves (these halves can be objects of any size and surface stiffness)
* two removable urethane marker mounts
* eight removable object weights (optional components)
